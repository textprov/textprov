"""Extended grapheme cluster segmentation (UAX #29).

The segmenter reads the property tables in `_ucd.py`, generated from one
pinned Unicode version, instead of whatever the interpreter's `unicodedata`
ships. Every port segments from the same tables, so a cluster marked by one
decodes as one cluster in the others. Rule numbers below refer to UAX #29,
Grapheme Cluster Boundary Rules.
